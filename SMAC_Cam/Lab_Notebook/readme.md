This folder is where scans of lab notebook pages will go. All interns will scan in pages from their lab notebook, or export in a suitable format if using a digital lab notebook, and update them to this folder. Files should be named in a way that makes it easy to reference and find later.

### This folder must be updated at least once every two weeks, at a minmimum.
