# Intro

 Seepage is defined as the slow leaking of a liquid through a pourus material. This action can lead to detramental consequences when it goes unmonitored in a dam. Currently, monitoring this requires personnel to go out and observe each location and note what they see. To optimize this process, we developed a camera system to deploy in multiple locations along the Augusta canal. We coined this solution SMAC (Seepage Monitoring at the Augusta Canal). SMAC allows us remotely monitor these sites and establish long term data collection. This device also uses wireless communications and solar charging to make it suitable for long term deployement.

 ## Focus as of 12/01/2025 - Battery Life 

 With our current solar charging and low power measures established we are not hitting out desired lifetime. Currently we are getting a max of two weeks for our device. 
 To try to imporve this we are replacing the 12v 5amph lead acid battery with a LiFePo4 that has similar specs. This is expected to boost the efficiency of solar charging. If that does not work I plan to incorporate a RTC/coin cell solution to use stricter low power methods in the circuit
